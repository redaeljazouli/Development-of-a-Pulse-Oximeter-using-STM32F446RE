# Development-of-a-Pulse-Oximeter-using-STM32F446RE
This project, undertaken during my 4th year of training in electronic engineering and industrial informatics, aims to develop a functional and reliable pulse oximeter. It encompasses two main components: an analog part and a digital part, integrating cutting-edge technologies and high-quality components.
Analog Part:

SFH7072 Sensor: Utilized to detect variations in hemoglobin reflection, which is crucial for measuring blood oxygen levels.

Transimpedance Circuit: Converts the current signals generated by the sensor into usable voltage signals, serving as the initial stage in signal conditioning.

Amplification Module: Amplifies the analog signal to ensure accurate and reliable sampling, thus preparing the signal for digital conversion.

Digital Part (shared):

STM32F446RE Microcontroller: At the heart of the digital part, it is responsible for data management and processing. It encompasses the following functionalities:

ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter): Converts the analog signals into digital data for further processing and analysis.

PWM Control: Generated by the microcontroller's GPIO, it facilitates precise and efficient control of the sensor.

SparkFun Display: Integrated into the system to visually present the SpO2 levels and heart rate, providing a user-friendly interface and enhancing the functionality of the device we used a SPI connection .

This project represents a significant milestone in my training, combining skills in electronic engineering and industrial informatics to create a vital medical device. It serves not only as a demonstration of technical proficiency but also as a potential contribution to medical technology.
